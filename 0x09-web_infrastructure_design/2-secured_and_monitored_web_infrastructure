2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure design URL :

Specifics explanations about this infrastructure :
    For every additional element, why you are adding it :
    Added elements:
        - 1 SSL Certificate : used to secure and encrypt HTTP requests/responses sent and received
         between the client and servers
        - 3 firewalls for each component : to ensure safe communication and protection against cyber attacks
         by shielding the network from hackers and malicious programs or traffic.
        - 3 monitoring clients : used for quality control to monitor and diagnosis server's performance

    What are firewalls for:
        - To ensure safe communication and protection against cyber attacks
         by shielding the network from hackers and malicious programs or traffic.

    Why is the traffic served over HTTPS :
        - Traffic served over HTTPS to secure and encrypt the flow of data that is being transmitted between
        the client and the server, like sensitive informations, credentials, passwords...,because HTTP send data as plain text
        while HTTPS send encrypted data to prevent malicious actions or cyber attacks like MITM (Man-in-the-middle)

    What monitoring is used for :
        - used for quality control to monitor and diagnosis server's performance, health, and availability
         to ensure they are running optimally and to diagnosis and identify any issues that may occur;
         therefore to prevent downtime and ensure availability and uptime, optimize resource utilization, network performance,
         error tracking and logs.

    How the monitoring tool is collecting data :
        -Monitoring tools collect data from servers through various methods, mainly by tracking server activity
        and collecting and analyzing logs and metrics from application server MySQL database server and Nginx web server.

    Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS :
        - QPS quantifies the velocity at which traffic flows into a server, so it would be a good approach to monitor
        this metric because it helps determine whether server scaling is necessary or not, to efficiently
         manage usage demands and resources.

The issues are with this infrastructure:

    Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue because it can involve security level concerns such as
    decryption at the load balancer which expose the decrypted data within the load balancer before being forwarded
    to the backend servers, and performance concerns as the SSL encryption and decryption is resource intensive task
    which may lead to a heavy usage for the load balancer CPU as result, forms a bottleneck issues in the performance
    under heavy traffic.

    Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue ?
     -> because it is not scalable and can be a weakness for the whole infrastructure in case of a failure.

    Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem?
    -> because in case there is an issue in one component can lead to many potential issues in the web infrastructure
    including maintenance, scalability, resources bottleneck and efficiency, single point of failure, complex load balancing etc
