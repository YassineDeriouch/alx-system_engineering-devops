Specifics explanations about this infrastructure

For every additional element, why you are adding it :
    - one additional server is added as a secondary standby server to handle and distribute incoming traffic,
    through the load balancer,to prevent the overload on the primary server in order to ensure
    the availability of the system and prevent any traffic load fail.

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
    - The load balancer uses Round Robin algorithm so the incoming requests from the clients, are being distributed
    across a group of the existing servers in a successive order.

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
    - This load-balancer enables Active-Active setup, where both servers are actively running simultaneously
    the same type of service.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
    - A database primary-replica (master-slave) cluster is a configuration where one database is the master DB
     handles read/write operations, while one or more replica servers are the slaves, their job is to replicate or copy
     the data from the master DB in order to ensure that all users share the same level of information.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
    - The difference between the primary node and the replica node, regarding the application,
    is that the master database is considered as the accurate authentic data source,
    while the replica database is synchronized to it.
