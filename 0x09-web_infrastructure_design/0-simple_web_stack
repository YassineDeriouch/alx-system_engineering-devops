 The issues are with this infrastructure are :

    - SPOF : a vulnerability that makes the whole system down if one single element fails .
    - Downtime when maintenance needed means when an element needs maintenance or a reparation, the whole system require
    to be shut down, which is not operational for the client to wait hours to get his needs from the website.
    - Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic means an overload of incoming traffic to the server,
    can be a threat to the server capacity and there is no way to scale the services with backups which
    may lead to make the system freeze or unable to be used anymore.
